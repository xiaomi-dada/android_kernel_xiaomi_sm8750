 * Charging around what the user is doing.
 *
 * A phone charging while it is being used has to trade charging speed against
 * everything else the user notices: how warm the phone gets in the hand, how
 * long the battery lasts over years, whether a game stutters because the
 * charger is heating the board.  Userspace knows what is on screen and what
 * the user has asked for; this is where it says so, and where those requests
 * are turned into the limits the charging strategies work to.
 *
 * The requests are votes rather than settings: several of them can be in
 * force at once, and the most conservative wins.
